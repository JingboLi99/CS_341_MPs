 * C is notorious for having relatively annoying string manipulation interfaces
 * as compared to other languages such as C++ and python. In this MP, we're
 * going to define and implement sstring, a wrapper around C strings that
 * provides a higher level interface to dealing with strings. You will actually
 * define the implementation of `sstring` in sstring.c. Since the struct
 * definition is only present in the `.c` file, that definition is essentially
 * 'private' and as a result, outside of the implementing `.c` file, the
 * internal members of sstring cannot be accessed. As a consequence, an
 * `sstring` can only be declared on the heap (at least, not without some
 * non-trivial refactoring).
